# Computational-BiologyEx3

This exercise has been writen by Roi Avraham and Dina Englard.
# Description
For this assignment we build neural networks with the help of a genetic algorithm that will 
learn the patterns and be able to predict whether a certain string matches the pattern. 
We determined the structure of the network: the number of layers and the number of 
connections for each problem(nn0 and nn1).
<br>There are 4 exe files:
1) buildnet0.exe
2) buildnet1.exe
3) runnet0.exe
4) runnet1.exe

# The output files:
- buildnet0.exe output file named wnet0.txt. This file contains definitions of the network structure 
and the weights of the network for nn0.
- buildnet1.exe output file named wnet1.txt. This file contains definitions of the network structure 
and the weights of the network for nn1.
- runnet0.exe output file named classifications0.txt. This file Contains 20000 lines where each line contains
the appropriate classification (ie the number 0 or 1) for this string
- runnet1.exe output file named classifications1.txt. This file Contains 20000 lines where each line contains
the appropriate classification (ie the number 0 or 1) for this string

# Installation
In order to run buildnet0.exe, you will need to enter the next command in the terminal:
<br> buildnet0.exe {path of the train file} {path of the test file}
<br>
<br> In order to run buildnet1.exe, you will need to enter the next command in the terminal:
<br> buildnet1.exe {path of the train file} {path of the test file}
<br>
<br> In order to run runnet0.exe, you will need to enter the next command in the terminal:
<br> runnet0.exe {path of wnet0} {path of testnet0}
<br>
<br> In order to run runnet1.exe, you will need to enter the next command in the terminal:
<br> runnet1.exe {path of wnet1} {path of testnet1}
